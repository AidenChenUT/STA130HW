First we remove the winning door, which makes us guarantee that the first choice is wrong, then we re-add the winning door to the door list and remove the door we selected first, then reselect, if the second choice is correct, then the number of wins is increased by 1, otherwise the remaining door is correct, we lose.Then repeat this process until we have enough data to calculate the possibility."
